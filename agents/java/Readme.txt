Problem: 

	Create a pair of agents (labeled [1-9]) that work together to hunt
down bugs (labeled [B-N]) within an m by n map.
	
	Rounds are delimited by the server sending you a state update.
During each round you may send moves and chat messages back to the
server.  The last move and message you send will be used by the server
for the next set of updates.

	This kit includes a reference client implementation for the Java
programming language.

More Info:

	* Detailed Description: http://code.google.com/p/project-z/wiki/ProblemDescription
	* Client-to-Server network protocol: http://code.google.com/p/project-z/wiki/ActorProtocol
	* Server-to-Client network protocol: http://code.google.com/p/project-z/wiki/WorldStateProtocol

In this kit:
	* Readme.txt	- this guide
	* Makefile	- a GNU make file for building and running this sample and your implementation
	* Agent.java	- the base class for all Agents
	* Direction.java	- an enum representing the directions agents can move
	* Message.java	- a container class for agent-agent messages
	* Position.java - a container class for board positions
	* RandomAgent.java	- a stupid agent
	* SmarterAgent.java	- a smarter agent
	* State.java	- a container class for the world state
	* Server.jar	- a server implementation you can use to test.

To build examples:
	make all

To run examples:
	in seperate terminals run each of these commands
	java -jar Server.jar
	make hunter1go
	make hunter2go

To make your own implementation:
	create a source file
	extend Agent.java
	implement init and respondToChange
	update Makefile by copying one of the examples and replace the example source/object files with your own.
